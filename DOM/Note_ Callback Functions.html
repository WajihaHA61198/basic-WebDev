<p>In the previous video you saw something interesting:</p><p>Event listener&nbsp;syntax :&nbsp;</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">button.addEventListener("click", addListAfterClick);
input.addEventListener("keypress", addListAfterKeypress);</pre><p>You didn't see the function being called like this as you may have expected:&nbsp;</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">button.addEventListener("click", addListAfterClick());
input.addEventListener("keypress", addListAfterKeypress(event));</pre><p><br></p><p>This is something called a&nbsp;callback function. When that&nbsp;line of javascript runs, we don't want the addListAfterClick function to run because we are just adding the event listener now to wait for click or keypress. We want to let it know though that we want this action to happen when a click happens. So the function now automatically gets run (gets added the ()) every&nbsp;time the click&nbsp;happens. So we are passing a reference to the function without running it.</p>
